    > Notes:
        * This is the end of finals week for winter term. I want this to be done
            before spring break so I can give it some time off before I start

[ ] Schedule Thesis Defense
    > Due: 1 May 2020
    > To: Honors College (?)
    > Notes:
        * Talk with HC advisor to see who I talk to about this
        * This due date is less important than scheduling it two weeks prior to
            the defense. Ideally, I can schedule this as soon as I find a date
            and time that works for everyone.

[ ] Defend Thesis Project
    > Due: 15 May 2020
    > To: Committee
